<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

**Jungle Sanctuary** is a beautiful urban wildlife refuge housing primates of various species (mostly monkeys). While nothing beats actually being there, here is a project to help you experience how a wildlife sanctuary functions.
Everything from welcoming the primates to performing medical check, from allocating housing units to shopping for the amazing beings housed, it's all here. Let's dive in.

The journey of a primate in brief is as follows:
* First the incoming primate is welcomed to the Sanctuary.
* The first action item is to send the primate to isolation where its medical examination is performed.
* All the physical and personal characteristics like age, weight, gender, favorite food, specie type are documented and stored in the isolation unit.
* Once the primate clears medical exam, he/she is sent to enclosure unit where the primate can live happily along with other similar animals.
* The journey involves lot of backend process like checking availability in isolation and enclosures and performing medical tests. All the feature of the Sanctuary are listed in the [features](#list-of-features) section.

<!-- List of Features -->
## List of Features
The project Jungle Sanctuary provides following features/benefits to the user:
* Provides the list on all the primates housed in the sanctuary at point of time along with the details of their present location.
* Provides user the flexibility to look up for primates belonging to a particular type of species as to where they are currently housed.
* The project auto generates the list for food items with the quantity to be shopped based on every primates favorite food choice and their size.
* Initially the Sanctuary starts with a fixed number of isolation and enclosure units, but the project provides flexibity to expand these units when there is sufficient funding support.
* It allows provides user the functionality to create signs for a particular Enclosure Unit. 
  The Sign would include primates housed in that enclosure along with their name,gender and favorite food.These signs would be helpful for the visiors to know about the inhabitants.__

<!-- Assumptions -->
## Assumptions
To successfully implement the project, the following assumptions have been made 
1. The area of each enclosure is assumed to be same.
2. The primate is not allowed get in the sanctuary if the there is no space in isolation units.
3. Assumed that primates of different types won't be housed together in enclosures.
4. If enclosures are full, primate will be transferred to other sanctuaries. 

<!-- Limitations -->
## Limitations
1. The jungle sanctuary currently only houses monkeys, but can be extended to house any type of primates.
2. A centralised Database is not used yet, which will be a feature in coming days to have better storage system even when monkey is transferred 
to other sanctuaries.
